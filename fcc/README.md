Introduction: 

I've created concise note files for each of my JavaScript courses (FCC using MDN, ZTM Web Developer Course, and JS text book from Jon Duckett), aiming to finish them all by end of January 2024. These notes capture the essential concepts, syntax, and examples, serving as handy references and reflecting my progress in mastering JavaScript. They're my go-to companions on this learning journey. This also includes clarification notes from ChatGPT 3.5.
