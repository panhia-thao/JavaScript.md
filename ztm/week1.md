## Set your learning streak goal

set 100 day coding

## Browsing the web

For performance and optimization we need to learn about the web

laptop > web browser > google > ISP (internet service) > DNS (phonebook of list of URL)

Return: 

DNS > ISP > Google servers (computer or computer farm) text file (Hmtl, css and JS) that is sent  > web browser on computer. 

## Breaking Google 

Developer tools

We can inspect a google web page by using inspect and element to modify google page. 

The brower is a piece of software that can recieve files from servers and translate it (make it pretty) in the world. 

## The internet backbone

computer is a network of computers

## Traceroute 
command prompt
Traceroute can map the locations that the data of a website was pass thru. 


A traceroute provides a map of how data on the internet travels from its source to its destination.

What is traceroute used for? 

* figuring out the routing hops data has to go thru

* trace response delays, trace location, points of failure, full visual representation of each hop.

        How To Run a Traceroute,

        MAC

        Open up an instance of Terminal.
        Type in the phrase “traceroute [hostname]” and press enter.

        Windows

        Go to the Start menu.
        Select Run.
        Type in “cmd” and then hit “OK.” This initiates a command prompt.
        Type in “tracert [hostname]” and press enter.
        The term “hostname” or host is the website you are interested in or the IP address of a server, router, or device. The traceroute reports on this destination point. After the traceroute is done, it terminates on its own.

Syntax in command prompt: 
> tracert -4 google.com


Summary: To located how many locations or computer a file has to hop before it gets to our browser we use command prompt > traceroute or tracert to request the list of destinations. The map can help with browser technical 

## Developer Fundamental

Website Performance: 
> location of server, how many trips and size of files.

location of server if the server is close to you, the hop  makes it faster to load

how many trips - the less trip, the faster it loads

size of files - for ex. 100 megabyes slower vs kilobytes. 

## What does a developer do? 

Frontend developer - website visual
Backend developer - backend 
> frontend + backend = full stack developer

## WWW vs Internet

The history of the world wide web (WWWW). 
[Tim Berners-Lee](/img/tim.png)

Tim Berners-Lee first web developer, created the browser and server and the first website in 1969 basically as a military project where it connects some university thru the 70s to the 80s to share academic documents faster pace. There was already computer. 

A decentralized program. 

## HTML, CSS, JS

website that links

HTML === text === Element tab
CSS === visual === style tab
JS === interactive === console

## Developer fundamental: II

multiple web broswers === broswer wars

chrome vs. e vs firefox vs sarif
phone screen size vs computer screen size
web are created to share document amongst each other

standards: 

website fit browser for code. 
test each browser. 


## Developer do? 

Frontend - user see (html, css, JS + react)
Backend - Server technology uses (node.js and express.js) and database (postgreSQL, MongoDB)


## Developer History 

Full stack Dev. in the old days

Front-end developer (html, css, js + jquery)

Back end developer aka lamp stack- Apache Server (php), Database (mySQl)

## Build your first website


text editor allow us to write codes

use sublime

## Developer fundamentals: III

developer === problem solving

What is Doctype? 

doctype tell the browser that it is html 5 it has more syntax and tags.
