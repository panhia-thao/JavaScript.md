command prompt
Traceroute can map the locations that the data of a website was pass thru. 


A traceroute provides a map of how data on the internet travels from its source to its destination.

* figuring out the routing hops data has to go thru

* trace response delays, trace location, points of failure, full visual representation of each hop.

        How To Run a Traceroute,

        MAC

        Open up an instance of Terminal.
        Type in the phrase “traceroute [hostname]” and press enter.

        Windows

        Go to the Start menu.
        Select Run.
        Type in “cmd” and then hit “OK.” This initiates a command prompt.
        Type in “tracert [hostname]” and press enter.
        The term “hostname” or host is the website you are interested in or the IP address of a server, router, or device. The traceroute reports on this destination point. After the traceroute is done, it terminates on its own.

Syntax in command prompt:
