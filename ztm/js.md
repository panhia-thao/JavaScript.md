the script tag is for javaScript and its best practice to put it on the bottom or defer it if its on top due to loading. 
You want to load html and css file before js. 

alert() 
prompt() its a function that pops up a prompt it has its own screen
console.log() 

Js has built in functions. 
arguments are what is given to the function for example 
console.log("hello") > "hello" is the argument 
you can have multiple of arguments.

There are two ways to create functions: 

    function sayHello() {
        console.log("hello");
    }

We need to run a function to see it in the console

    sayHello() 


What is a function? 

Function

> input (5, 10) > function > return

In a function we need to return to not get *undefine*  by using *return*

Functions are variables 

parameter and arguments are interchangable 

What is parameters? 
how many paramenters (a,b)

What is arguement?  are (4,5)
what are the arguements
