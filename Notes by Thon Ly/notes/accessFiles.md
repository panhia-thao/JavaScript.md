# Access Files Notes 

Every file has a location known as the address location in each computer. This is known as the path to the file. 

The path is also know as the address. 

Path starts with
> / or a slash

There are two types of path; absolute and relative

### Absolute: 

Start at the root node: 

> c:

Absolute path: 

> c:/

> c://html 


### Relative: 

Has no slash |
near by for example its parent

### Going backward to files 

> .../

### Going forward 

page/page.hmtl

Always look at what page your at and if you go back always look at the parent.
